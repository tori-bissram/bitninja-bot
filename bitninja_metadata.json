See it as feedback rather than failure.\nSpend some time thinking about what led to this setback. Identify one or two lessons and\nwrite them down.\nWhat to Focus on: Focus on seeing challenges as opportunities for growth. Instead of\nviewing the defeat as a dead end, consider it a stepping stone that can help you improve.\nWork on building resilience by learning to adapt. Life rarely goes perfectly according to plan,\nso focusing on flexibility helps you stay steady and calm even in uncertain situations.\nHolidays/Events - Oct-Dec\n11/20 - India All-Hands\n11/28-11/29 - Thanksgiving (US)\n12/24-1/1 - End of Year Closure (ALL)\nIT Critical Support Plan\n1/6?-1/10? - Mike travel to India (Bangalore and Virar)\nTeam Updates\nNEW START DATE: New IT Director, Antony Godwin, to start 11/18 (based in Bangalore; will\nstart 1st week in Virar)\nCompany / People Team Updates\nQ3 Results\n$12M in pipeline vs. target of $17.9M\nDown vs. target; flat YoY39\nExpansion pipeline record over $4M; New Business pipeline down 25% from prior\nquarter\n$4.2M in bookings vs. target of $5.3M\nAPAC & EMEA with strong performance, AMER below target\nPartner sourced bookings above target\nExisting Business beat target; New business below target\nChurn impact of Riot Games; Retention rate of 87% vs. target of 95%\nCustomer Expansion rate of 17% vs. target of 15%\nIT Security Focus\nAssessing RawEng endpoint protection options\nContext aware access\nDarkWeb monitoring services\nPeople team leveling framework review coming up (job levels, responsibilities)\nUS Open Enrollment (benefits) - starts 11/12\nWins and Major Milestones \nBusy Q3 for\nProcurement!Appreciate driving deal closures and\nPOCs in Q3!Senthamil Selvan\nOn demand scan for\nEndpointsKudos for getting the Ondemand\nscans done on the Windows\nEndpoint devices.Pravin Salian and Jaykishan\nTracking the password\nResets for users Did a great job in tracking and\nfollowing up with password resets\nfor Non-IT appsGokila A\nTeam focus &\nproductivityAppreciate efforts across the team\nto keep everything on track and\nsupport the business without a hitch\nas we\u02bcve been backfilling the IT\nDirector role.

Limit multitasking\nand reduce time spent on low-value activities. Use tools like to-do lists or time-blocking to\nstructure your time effectively. Share responsibilities with others to concentrate on your\nstrengths. Reflect on your activities and adjust priorities to stay focused.\nWhat to Focus on: Focus on areas where your skills and expertise add the most value. Invest\ntime in activities that enhance your knowledge and abilities. Build connections that support\npersonal and professional growth. Concentrate on outcomes rather than simply staying busy.\nPrioritize health and well-being to maintain sustained productivity..\nRemember: Productivity thrives on purposeful focus. By being selective about your priorities,\ntasks, and commitments, you channel your energy toward what truly matters. Focus on\nimpactful goals, leverage your strengths, and maintain clarity in your actions to achieve\nmeaningful results while avoiding unnecessary distractions.

Too often, people get caught up in societal expectations, the opinions of\nothers, or the fear of failure. But in the end, the only life you have to live is your own.\nKey Takeaways:\n1. Follow Your Passion\n2. Avoid Comparison\n3. Take Risks\n4. Be Authentic\n5. Make Every Moment Count\nExample:\nConsider someone who has always dreamed of becoming an artist but chooses a corporate job because their family expects it.\nYears later, they feel unfulfilled and regret not following their passion. On the other hand, imagine another person who takes the risk\nof pursuing art, despite the uncertainty. They may face challenges, but they wake up every day doing what they love.\nThis month, challenge yourself to reflect on whether you\u02bcre living for yourself or for others. Make choices that align with your dreams,\nand don\u02bct be afraid to carve your own path.\nCompany / People Team Updates (Mike)\nAustin, TX Accelerate recap\n$100M ARR by end of FY26\n3 Key Goals:\nBe One: Lytics + Contentstack Unification\n1 + 1 = Magic\nBe the DXP: Multi-product Mindset\nIncrease ARR per customer\nBe Unforgettable: Command the Market\n$86M in new pipeline\nFY26 Planning - IT Goals\nEnablement, Ownership - Own your segment of the business and drive great results.  \nFrom Administrator \u2192  Owner\nApps Optimization - How can we optimize use of our productivity apps?\nInfoSec - Continue to drive improvements in securing our tools and data\nUpskilling - Building our skills to enhance our contributions\nCustomer experience - Improving process and services to delight our internal users/customers\nDocumentation - Documenting policies & process and making them easy to find and understand\nUS & India Holiday(s) Mar-May \u02bc25105\nHigh5 (Overall: Until Week 9)\nLearning & Development (Period: Feb\u02bc25)\nStudy Time (Period: Until Week 9)14 - Holi (India)14 - Tamil New Year\n(Chennai)01 - Labor day (India)\n31 - Eid Al-Fitr\n(India)18 - Good Friday\n(India)26 - Memorial day (US)March April May\nAntony Godwin 2 4\nBhuvan Daruwala 4 2\nGokila A 2 2\nJaykishan Gusani 7 2\nPravin Salian 2 1\nShawn Adams 5 4\nSenthamil Selvan 1 3Name High5 Received High5 Given\nShawn Adams Google Project\nManagement3 Hours\nGokila A Jira Administration150 Minutes\nPravin Salian Python for Non-\nProgrammers2 hr 20 min\nJaykishan GusaniNetwork + 180 Minutes\nSenthamil SelvanCertified Procurement\nProfessional2 hours\nBhuvan DaruwalaAdvanced Google\nWorkspace\nAdministrator2 hoursName Learning / Course Time Utilized\nShawn Adams Google Project\nManagement2\nAbhishek JumdeITILv4 4\nPravin Salian Python for Non-\nProgrammers2\nJaykishan GusaniCompTIA Network+3Name Learning / Course Sessions Completed106\n=============================================================================\nIT Helpdesk Ticket Status\n=============================================================================Gokila A Jira Cloud for Admin2\nManoj Effective\nCommunication2\nWins and Major Milestones \nSonicwall Firewall Firmware\npatching@Jaykishan Gusani@Bhuvan\nDaruwala\nCXC Assets Audit @Shawn Adams (Deactivated)\n@Pravin Salian@Jaykishan Gusani\nFY\u02bc26 Goals @Bhuvan Daruwala@Antony\nGodwin\nApplication Ownership @all\nHandling Slack outage and\ntimely updates to company@Shawn Adams (Deactivated)\nA total of 19 orders, including\nboth renewals and new\npurchases, were closed in\nFebruary.@Senthamil SelvanWin/Milestone Contributor(s)\n107\nHelpdesk CSAT Survey (Feb\u02bc25) :\nTotal Survey response for the month of February\u02bc25 :  73 out of 242\nComments: \n Thanks to IT team for their prompt support and help on this request, this was needed by the TSO leadership for the ensuing\naccelerate event.\n Thanks to IT team in totality for always acting promptly on all the requests raised.\n Shawn was awesome!\n============================================================================\nIT Projects Ticket Status\n============================================================================\n108\nLumos, Patch Management and Endpoint Security Updates : \n============================================================================\nIT Procurement\n============================================================================\n109\nRaw Engineering - Zoom Renewal\nViva Glint - Additional Licenses\nProcurement Requests Status\nPlanned for this month:\nOthers?\nBFA Off-boarding \nComplete 100%Slack Migration\nManage docker app using JumpCloud and restrict end-users from installing\nLaptop refresh program for eligible users\nClosure on SAML for Saas Application\nLytics Migration - Ongoing 110\n2025-03-12: Weekly Meeting (Week 10)\nTeam Updates\nWisdom Byte for the Week\n\"In the middle of every difficulty lies opportunity.\" \u2013 Albert Einstein\nWhen we face difficulties, we often feel discouraged or stuck.

While Monday.com offers Google SSO, our testing indicates that it functions more like\nGoogle OAuth.\n2. Another issue is that it automatically creates a user and assigns them a Paid seat without\nany manual input.\n3. The above automatic provisioning behavior cannot be controlled or managed from the\nGoogle Admin side.The only option is to enforce MFA instead of SAML SSO. \nAdobe\nFor Adobe SAML SSO, an Enterprise plan is required. While our Adobe.com  login initially\nindicated an Enterprise plan, further investigation with Adobe support revealed the following:\nWe are currently on an Adobe Business plan with a Teams license, which does not include\nEnterprise features.\nThe exact plan details were unclear after ownership was transferred to IT.\nSupport case details: ADB-37305118-D4F1\nAs administrators, we cannot enforce Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). However, users can\nenable 2FA individually by accessing their Adobe: Creative, marketing and docume\nnt management solutions  login and navigating to Account > Security Settings310\nOngoing - Work-in-Progress Apps: \nLinearB - We are still working with the LinearB support team to resolve issues with logging in\nvia the service provider portal, as currently only the IdP login is functional.\nCloudflare - Testing was successful; however, we have reached out to the support team\nbecause the portal lacks an SSO login option, and there are limitations with IdP-initiated\nlogins. \nSource:\n311\nApp specific notes312\n1Password : Reason for not enabling SAML\nFindings:\nOur 1Password subscription supports Single Sign-On (SSO) via Google as the identity\nprovider. However, after conducting thorough testing, we encountered several issues that\nprevent us from proceeding with the available Google SSO option. The following points\nhighlight the main challenges:\n1. Google SSO and Password Requirement:\nWhile 1Password does offer Google SAML-based SSO, our testing revealed that users are\nrequired to enter their Google account password to access the app. This is the expected\nbehavior; however, the complexity arises from our organization's Google password policy.\n2. Google Password Policy Conflict:\nOur Google password policy enforces complex passwords with no reuse and requires a\npassword rotation every 90 days. As a result, users began saving their Google credentials\nwithin 1Password to manage their password updates. This created a \"deadlock\" situation,\nwhere the password required to unlock 1Password was stored inside the vault itself.\n3. Unlocking the Vault:\nIn such cases, unless users have memorized their Google password, it becomes almost\nimpossible to unlock the vault, as the app relies on the Google password for initial\nauthentication. While features like biometric or PIN-based unlocking are available, these\ndo not help if the app has been quit and relaunched. In such cases, the app will still prompt\nfor the password and not allow biometric or PIN-based authentication.\nSummary:\nUnfortunately, this issue cannot be managed or controlled from either the Google Admin\nconsole or 1Password\u02bcs administrative settings. Given these limitations, the only feasible\nsolution is to enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) as an alternative to SAML-based\nSSO for added security and smoother user experience.\nMFA was successfully implemented in November 2024.313\nMonday.com : Reason for not enabling SAML\nMonday.com\nFor Monday.com SSO, we are encountering the following issues, which prevent us from\nproceeding with the currently available Google SSO option:\n1.

This change will allow\nyou to log in to Slack using your Contentstack Google Workspace credentials, providing a\nmore secure and seamless login experience.\nHere\u02bcs next steps, and what you need to do:\nOn Monday 9th Dec 2024 at 9:00 AM IST [GMT: 3:30 AM] The IT team will schedule a\nmaintenance window to transition from OAuth SSO to SAML SSO. This process will require\ntemporarily disabling OAuth SSO.\n1. During this time, you will receive an email notification for setting up a Slack password with \nSubject : [Slack] Single sign-on disabled (DO NOT have to take any action on that email).\n2. Once SAML SSO is enabled you will receive an email notification (similar to below image)\nto Authenticate the Slack accounts with Contentstack Google Account.\nEmail Subject : [Slack] Single sign-on enabled316\nImpact\nYou will be logged out of Slack from ALL YOUR DEVICES and will have to Login back on\neach of those\nUser Action Required: After the transition, you will need to bind your existing Slack\naccount to the new SAML SSO profile. This will involve clicking a link in the email\nnotification you receive and completing the binding process within 72 hours.\nApps and Customizations: All apps and customizations integrated into Slack will remain\nunaffected during the transition.\nWhat You Need to Do\n1. Stay Informed:\nKeep an eye out for further communication from the IT team regarding the transition.\n2. Complete the Binding Process:\n317\nOnce you receive the email notification from Slack, follow the instructions to bind your\nSlack account to the new SAML SSO profile. If you miss the 72-hour window, the IT\nteam will assist you in resending the binding email.\nSupport\nIf you have any questions or encounter any issues during this process, please reach out to\nthe IT Helpdesk via this link or email us at helpdesk@contentstack.com.\nWe appreciate your cooperation and understanding as we work to enhance the security and\nusability of our systems.

Initial Configuration\nSet up the Google Workspace SAML app with the following key parameters:\nEntity ID: Provided by LearnUpon.\nACS URL: Provided by LearnUpon.\nName ID:\nFormat: EMAIL.\nValue: Primary email (from Google Directory attributes).\nConfigured LearnUpon SAML Settings:\nEnabled SAML 2.0.\nSet the Identity Provider Location (SSO URL) provided by Google:\nSet the Name Identifier Format to:\nurn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress.\n2. Issues Encountered\n1. SP-Initiated Login Fails:\nUsers encountered a 403 Error: app_not_configured_for_user when\naccessing:\n2. IdP-Initiated Login Works:\nDirect access to the IdP SSO URL functioned correctly:\n3. Suspected Mismatch:\n1https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2/idp?idpid=<unique_id>\n1https://contentstack.learnupon.com/saml/init\n1https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2/idp?idpid=<unique_id>327\nGoogle Workspace's Name ID format (EMAIL) and LearnUpon's expected format\n(emailAddress) did not align.\nSAML assertions appeared correctly from the IdP side but failed at the SP.\n3. Debugging Process\n1. Reviewed Name ID Settings:\nVerified Google was sending EMAIL and mapping it to the user's Primary email.\nUpdated LearnUpon's Name Identifier Format multiple times to align:\nEMAIL\nurn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress\nCustom values like primaryemail.\n2. Used Debugging Tools:\nSAML Tracer and similar tools were used to:\nInspect SAML requests and responses.\nIdentify mismatches in <NameID> formatting and assertions.\nConfirm Google Workspace sent valid SAML assertions.\n3. Engaged LearnUpon Support:\nThe LearnUpon team used their SAML debugging/sniffer tools and determined the\nissue was on the SP side.\nThey adjusted their internal settings to correctly resolve the Entity ID and accept\nassertions from Google Workspace.\nResolution\nThe LearnUpon team made changes on their end to resolve the issue.\nThe Entity ID in Google Workspace and LearnUpon was updated.\nAfter these changes, both SP-initiated and IdP-initiated logins worked seamlessly.\nKey Lessons Learned\n1. SP-Side Issues: Even when the IdP is configured correctly, the SP may require\nadjustments.328\n2. SAML Debugging Tools: Tools like SAML Tracer are essential for identifying assertion\nmismatches and tracking the login flow.\n3. Collaboration is Critical: Involving the SP's support team can quickly resolve\nmisconfigurations that aren't visible from the IdP side.\n4. Entity ID Accuracy: Ensuring the Entity ID aligns between the IdP and SP is critical for\nsuccessful SAML integration.\nFinal Checklist\nGoogle Workspace (IdP)\nEntity ID: Updated to match LearnUpon\u02bcs requirements.\nSSO URL:\nName ID:\nFormat: EMAIL.\nValue: Primary email.\nLearnUpon (SP)\nACS URL: Configured correctly.\nName Identifier Format: Configured to align with Google's EMAIL.\nSAML Hardening: Enabled to ensure security.\nOutcome\nThe SAML 2.0 integration between Google Workspace and LearnUpon is now fully functional.\nUsers can seamlessly log in via both SP-initiated and IdP-initiated flows.\n1https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2/idp?idpid=<unique_id>329\nSSO Communications\nSingle Sign-On (SSO) for LearnUpon is Coming\u00a0\nYour Way on December 17, 2024\nNOTE: You are receiving this notification because you have a LearnUpon account login.\nThe IT team will be working to enable Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) Single\nSign-On (SSO) for LearnUpon, effective December 17, 2024\nWhat is Single Sign-On?\nSingle sign-on is an authentication method that allows users to sign in using one set of\ncredentials to several related yet independent software systems.\nWhy are we doing this?\nThe IT team is executing this project to help ensure we remain safe from cyber attacks.

Austin Womes Club : Migration from MS to Google Wo354\nAccess Control Projects355\nGoogle Workspace - Context Aware Access (CAA)356\nCAA - Introduction\nContext-Aware Access in Google Workspace is a security feature that allows administrators\nto define and enforce detailed access control policies for apps and services based on\nspecific contextual conditions.\nThis ensures that users can access Google Workspace resources only under secure and\ncompliant circumstances. \nThese policies are based on a dynamic evaluation of contextual attributes like user identity,\nlocation, device security status, IP address and so on.\nKey Features of Context-Aware Access\nDevice Security:\nApply policies based on device status if company-issued devices.\nVerify the device meets security standards - Allow access to apps only if a user storage\ndevice is encrypted or secure passwords locks or has updated OS.\nIP Address and Network:\nEnforce policies based on IP ranges  - Restrict access from flagged/suspicious IP ranges\nor allow access only from corporate networks or VPNs.\nLocation-Based Access: Restrict access based on geographical location\nUser Identity and Role: Apply policies based on user groups or organizational units.\nImportant Note:\nFor the device to be determined and assessed by CAA, Chrome Extension has to be\ninstalled and users will be able to access Google workspace or any apps mentioned in the\naccess level only on Chrome Browsers.\nAs only from Chrome browser which will have the endpoint verification extension, google\nwill be able to read the device status.\nCAA works on:\nGoogle workspace Web apps, desktop & mobile apps, and Native apps on desktop.\u00a0357\nFor apps that are core services (Gmail, calendar, drive etc..) and additional Google\nservices(Looker studio and so on), policy evaluation is continuous.\nThe exception is SAML apps, which are evaluated on sign-in as the policy is rechecked\nonly when the user session ends and they sign in again.\nPrerequisites - Specific for our workspace\nTo implement and deploy Context-Aware Access in Google Workspace we need to plan and\nexecute the \nDefine Security Requirements\nIdentify google apps or resources require context-aware access (like Gmail, G-drive ).\nIdentify the conditions to be enforced (like device type, device OS, encryption status, IP\naddress or geolocation).\nTarget Audience (like specific users, groups, or organizational units).\nEnable Endpoint Verification Before Setting Policies: \nIf device policy is enforced in an access level, endpoint verification needs to be set up to\ntrack devices accessing Google Workspace data.\nFrom Google Admin console \u2192 Menu\u00a0 \u2192  Devices > Mobile & endpoints > Settings >\nUniversal > Data access > Endpoint verification Turn ON\nInstall Endpoint verification Extension:\nEither let users install the extension - Set up endpoint verification on your computer. \nAdmins can also force-install the extension in the Admin console - reference steps\nMobile Device Management Configuration: \nEnsure all mobile devices are managed through Google Endpoint Management, using\neither the basic or advanced mode.\nInstructions - either basic or advanced.\n358\nOrganize your users into organizational units or groups: \nTo phase the rollout and to restrict access levels for specific groups or users, access levels\ncan be assigned based on org units or groups. \n(Optional, only for company owned device policy):\nTo enforce a device policy that requires company-owned devices, admins need to upload\nthe list of serial numbers for the company-owned devices. For instructions - Add\ncompany-owned devices to the inventory.359\nCAA - Deployment\nCreate access levels:\nNavigate to Admin Console, from Security > Access and Data Control > Context-Aware\nAccess.\nClick on Access Levels, Select Create Access Level.\nDevice Policy: Specify managed or company-owned devices.\nLocation Policy: Add allowed IP address ranges or restrict access by region.\nNetwork Policy: Define trusted networks (e.g., corporate VPN).\nCombine these conditions using AND/OR logic as required. \n<p>Create Access Level</p>\n<p>Define Access Level</p>360\nAccess levels can be created in 2 different modes, Basic and Advanced. Basic mode\nprovides with a list of predefined attributes that you can select. If you need to use\nattributes that are not in the interface, build a custom access level in Advanced mode\ninstead.\u00a0\nDetailed instructions on Creating access levels \nAssign access levels to one or more apps.\nOnce we have access levels created, it can be assigned to one or more apps for the\nselected OU\u02bcs and groups. \nFrom Admin console menu > Security > Access and data control > Context-Aware Access\n> Assign access levels to see the list of apps.\nHover over an\u00a0app and click Assign, to assign the same access levels to multiple apps at\nonce, check the boxes next to the apps and, at the top, click Assign.\nSelect the required access levels on the left and the Selected access levels are displayed\nto the right and are set to Monitor mode by default and Click Continue.\n361\n(Recommended) Check the Block users from accessing Google desktop and mobile\napps if access levels aren\u02bct met box to apply the access levels to users of native desktop,\nAndroid, and iOS apps and web apps. \n(Optional) Check the Block other apps from accessing the selected apps via APIs, if\naccess levels aren't met box to block apps from attempting to access Google Workspace\ndata through exposed public APIs .\nClick Continue to Review the selected scope, and the selected apps and selected access\nlevels, and the access level mode (monitor or active) and click Assign\nImportant Rollout recommendations:\nValidating Access levels in Monitor and Active Mode\nTurn on and turn off Context-Aware Access\n362\nRemediation messages.\nValidating Access levels in Monitor and Active Mode\nA successful deployment of Context-Aware access protects\u00a0Workspace data from risky\nusers, while ensuring that legitimate users are not blocked\nThe access levels initially can be assigned and validated in Monitor mode rather than\nactive mode. While assigning apps to access level by default the monitor mode gets\nselected. \nMonitor mode simulate the effects of enforcing an access level without actually blocking\nuser access.\nThe logged events in theContext-Aware Access log displays which users would be\nblocked if the access level were in active mode.\nIf an access policy has Active mode enabled, the policy is enforced immediately as we\nassign and save. \nTherefore it is important that only after verifying that an access level is working the way\nyou want it to, you can turn on actual enforcement by switching the access level to active\nmode.\nTurn on and turn off Context-Aware Access\nCAA can be enabled at various stages during the rollout. Enabling it early enforces\nassigned access levels immediately.\nInitial setup, including access level creation, assignment to apps, and endpoint verification,\ncan be done without enabling enforcement, allowing configuration to be completed before\nactivation. \n363\nIn case of user issues, Context-Aware Access can be temporarily disabled to investigate\nproblematic policies. Access levels can then be modified or removed as necessary for\nspecific organizational units or groups.\nTo Turn On/Off CAA > From Admin console menu > Security > Access and data control >\nContext-Aware Access > Verify if ON and when required can select Turn OFF.\nRemediation messages.\nTo customize the messages users get when app access is blocked, navigate to Security >\nAccess and data control > Context-Aware Access and click User message. \nUser messages include:\nRemediation messages\u2014These messages are system generated, and correspond to\nthe specific policy violation that blocked the user. Remediation messages present\nremediation options to the user so they can unblock their app access.\n364\nCustom messages\u2014Messages admins can add that offer specific help for the user, such\nas additional advice on getting unblocked .\nDefault message\u2014 An example default message is: Your organization's policy is blocking\naccess to this app. This message displays if you have not specified a remediation message\nor a custom message.\n365\nCAA - Assessment\nDevice is Screen\npassword protected .\nDevice Device encryption\nis encrypted.

The Admin Approvedcontext does not give\nthis warning sujesting that in emergency situations a google admin\ncould grant access to an offcorp deviceAdditional Considerations367\nAndroid EMM - Google endpoint management (GEM)\nGoogle endpoint management (GEM) provides a convenient way to manage your\norganization\u02bcs devices in the same Google Admin console where you manage Google\nWorkspace security, services, and accounts.\nGEM is an EMM (enterprise mobility management) provider that offers many of the features\navailable through Android Enterprise. However, the two are separate. Android Enterprise may\nhave more features available to implement by EMMs than what is available in GEM.\u00a0\nSetup Advanced mobile management option\u00a0\nAdvanced mobile management is required to use all features in the advanced and enterprise\nendpoint features.\nFrom Admin console menu > Devices > Mobile and endpoints > Universal settings\n>General > Mobile management > General and select Advanced option.\nWhen we upgrade from Basic to Advanced Mobile management we get the below\nnotification message\u00a0in end users Android mobiles to install \u201cAndroid Device Policy\u201d App\nfrom Playstore.\n368\nAfter the installation, the following screen will appear, prompting to set up the \u201cWork\nProfile\u201d.\n369\nAndroid work profiles\u00a0\nAn Android Work Profile separates work apps and data from personal apps and data. \nWith a Work Profile users can securely and privately use the same device for work and\npersonal purposes.

It ensures that users\ncan access resources only when they meet predefined security requirements, improving\nsecurity and compliance. \nAs Jumpcloud is our MDM we are evaluating option to restrict our Google workspace login\n(primarily) in devices which do not have Jumpcloud configured.\nPre Configurations:\nSSO with Google Workspace\nGoogle Workspace Integration in Cloud directories\nConditional Access policies Device certificates to be enabled for Device policies.\nConfiguring Jumpcloud SSO with Google workspace is mandatory for setting up Conditional\naccess policies\nAccording to Jumpcloud it is recommended to configure Google Workspace in both the\nCloud Directory and SSO in JumpCloud for complete integration of Google Workspace with\nJumpCloud.\nConditional Access policies Device certificates to be enabled for Device policies.\nTo use a policy with a device condition, you need to distribute device certificates to your\ndesktop devices.\u00a0\nDevice certificates for desktops allow authentication mechanisms to recognize if login\nrequests are coming from JumpCloud managed devices.\nThe JumpCloud certificate is only used by authentication policies.375\nFor the agent to install certificates, JumpCloud managed users need to be logged in to\ntheir device.\u00a0\nWhen a user accesses a resource, they need to be the same user who is logged in to the\ndevice. If a user accesses a resource and they\u02bcre not the same user who is logged in to the\ndevice, they\u02bcre treated as unmanaged.\u00a0\nDistribution can take a few minutes.\u00a0\nDesktop access policies using Device Trust Certificates are only supported on the\nfollowing browsers:\nWindows: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge\nmacOS: Google Chrome, Safari\nConfiguring Conditional Access Policy and Assessments:\nFrom Jumpcloud Admin login -> Security management -> Conditional policies -> Add new\npolicy\nSelect SSO Applications as resource for the Policy.\nAssignments:\nSelect Google Workspace SSO application and can create the required User group.\u00a0\n376\nCondition set for Device Management: For Jumpcloud managed device\nResults: While trying to access Google Workspace from either Jumpcloud user portal or from\nmail.google.com in a non-Jumpcloud configured device, access denied with message as\nbelow.\nadmin.google.com works irrespective of the Conditions set for Superadmin login.\n377\nSources:\nGoogle Workspace SSO with jumpcloud- SSO with Google Workspace .\u00a0\nConditional Access Policy - Get Started: Conditional Access Policies\nConfigure a Conditional Access Policy\n378\nAndroid EMM - JumpCloud\nIntroduction:\nAndroid Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) in JumpCloud is a solution that allows IT\nadministrators to manage Android devices and apps for their organization.\nUses a work profile, a separate self-contained space on the device that stores corporate\napps, data, and management policies.\u00a0\nA user\u02bcs personal apps and data remain on the device's primary profile and are never\naccessible or visible to the IT Admin or the EMM.\nThe JumpCloud agent is not installed on the Android mobile device. To initiate enrollment,\nusers need the install Android Device Policy application in their mobile device.\nAndroid EMM enrollment Types:\nWork Profile on Company owned device -\u00a0 A work profile can enable work and personal use\non a company-owned device.\u00a0\u00a0\nWork Profile on Personal device (our use case) - The Admin enables enrollment of a device\nowned by an employee, and the user enrolls the device via the User Portal. Work data and\npersonal data are automatically separated.\nFully Managed \u2013 no separate profile, The device is used exclusively for work and fully\ncontrolled.\nDedicated \u2013 no work profile, This device is a subset of fully managed devices and is used for\nsimple workflows, for single or small sets of apps.\u00a0\nRegistration to Configure Android EMM from Jumpcloud Admin Console:\nGo to\u00a0DEVICE MANAGEMENT > MDM.\nOn the MDM Home page, select the\u00a0Google\u00a0tab.\nClick\u00a0Begin Registration.

It first checks if a\nvalid token exists (i.e., one that has not expired). If the token is still valid, it returns that token.\nOtherwise, it makes a POST request to Box\u02bcs OAuth2 endpoint to obtain a new access token\nand updates the token and its expiry in the script properties.\nCode Explanation\n1. Retrieve Stored Token and Expiry Time\nThe function retrieves the current token expiry time from the script properties.\nIt calculates the current time (in seconds) and compares it with the stored expiration\ntime.\nIf the token is still valid (i.e., current time is less than the expiry), it returns the stored\naccess token.\n2. Token Refresh Process\nIf no valid token is found (i.e., token is expired or missing), the function prepares to\nrequest a new token.\nIt sets up the required parameters including client_id, client_secret, and \nenterprise_id (placeholders in the code).\nA POST request is sent to the Box OAuth2 endpoint\n(https://api.box.com/oauth2/token) with the proper payload.\n3. Handling the Response\nIf the response contains a valid access token, the function stores the new token along\nwith a new expiry time (current time + 3600 seconds, valid for 1 hour) in the script\nproperties.\nThe new access token is then returned.\nIf the request fails or does not return a token, an error is logged, and the function returns\nnull.383\nTextual Diagram\n+------------------------------------------------------+\n|\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 getBoxAccessToken() \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 |\n+------------------------------------------------------+\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0|\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0v\n+-------------------------------+\n| Retrieve script properties: \u00a0 |\n| - box_token_expiry\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 |\n| - box_access_token\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 |\n+-------------------------------+\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0|\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0v\n+-------------------------------+\n| Check if token is still valid |\n| (currentTime < tokenExpiry?)\u00a0 |\n+-------------------------------+\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0| Yes\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0v\n+-------------------------------+\n| Return existing box_access_token\u00a0 |\n+-------------------------------+\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0|\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No|\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0v\n+------------------------------------------------------+\n| Prepare token refresh: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 |384\n| - Set clientId, clientSecret, enterpriseId \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 |\n| - Build payload with grant_type and subject details\u00a0 |\n+------------------------------------------------------+\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0|\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0v\n+-------------------------------+\n| POST request to Box OAuth2 API |\n| URL: https://api.box.com/oauth2/token |\n+-------------------------------+\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0|\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0v\n+-----------------------------------------------+\n| Parse response JSON:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 |\n| - If access_token exists: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 |\n|\u00a0 \u00a0 - Update script properties (token, expiry) |\n|\u00a0 \u00a0 - Return new access_token\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 |\n| - Else: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 |\n|\u00a0 \u00a0 - Log error and return null\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 |\n+-----------------------------------------------+\nLogSheet Execution Capture : \n Sign in  to access  Google Drive Spreadsheet385\nBox Vendor Folder Sync\nOverview\nHigh-Level Flow\nDetailed Function Explanations\n1. boxgwsyncvendor()\n2. syncBoxFolder()\n3. handleBoxFile()\n4. handleBoxFolder()\n5. checkAndTrashOrphansRecursively()\n6. getDriveFilesAndFolders()\n7. parseBoxIdFromDescription()\n8. renameIfChanged()\n9. logEntry()\n10. sendErrorNotification()\nTextual Diagram\nSummary\nOverview\nThis script is designed to synchronize files and folders from Box to Google Drive by matching\nBox IDs. It uses a time-driven execution approach, saving progress in case the script nears\nits execution time limit. Logging is maintained through a Google Spreadsheet, and the script\nsupports error handling and retry mechanisms.\nKey points:\nTime-driven execution: The script tracks execution time and saves progress to resume\nlater if needed.\nProgress tracking: Uses PropertiesService to record progress using a unique\nkey per Box folder.\nError Handling & Retry: Implements retries for API calls (with exponential backoff) and\nlogs errors.\nOrphan Cleanup: Provides a function to recursively check for and trash files/folders in\nDrive that no longer exist in Box.\nBox & Drive Mapping: Uses custom descriptions on Drive items (e.g., \"Box File ID: XXX\")\nto correlate files and folders between Box and Google Drive.386\nHigh-Level Flow\nThe main entry point is the boxgwsyncvendor() function. It handles the initial setup,\nlogs the start of the sync, retrieves progress (if any), and then calls the recursive function \nsyncBoxFolder() to perform the synchronization. After processing, if no errors occur,\nthe progress is either cleared or saved if execution time is nearly exhausted.\nDetailed Function Explanations\n1. boxgwsyncvendor()\nPurpose:\nInitializes the sync process by setting constants, opening the log sheet, and retrieving the\nBox access token.\nKey Steps:\nSet configuration constants (DRY_RUN, MAX_RETRIES).\nRetrieve the root Box folder ID and corresponding Google Drive folder.\nOpen the logging spreadsheet and note the start time.\nRetrieve and log the start of synchronization.\nFetch any saved progress to resume from a previous incomplete run.\nInvoke syncBoxFolder() to begin recursive syncing.\nLog success or pause progress if the script needs to stop due to time constraints.\nHandle any exceptions by logging errors and sending error notifications.\n2. syncBoxFolder()\nPurpose:\nRecursively synchronizes a Box folder to the corresponding Google Drive folder. It\nprocesses files and subfolders, updates names if changed, and tracks progress based on\nAPI responses.\nKey Steps:\nBuild the Box API URL for the current folder using the offset and limit (set to 100).\nFetch the folder contents from Box, then parse and validate the JSON response.387\nRetrieve a listing of files and folders from the target Drive folder using \ngetDriveFilesAndFolders().\nFor each Box item:\nFile:\nAdd the file ID to a global set.\nIf the file does not exist on Drive, call handleBoxFile() to download and\ncreate it.\nIf the file exists, ensure its name matches by calling renameIfChanged().\nFolder:\nAdd the folder ID to a global set.\nIf the folder does not exist on Drive, call handleBoxFolder() to create it.\nIf the folder exists, verify and update its name if needed.\nRecursively call syncBoxFolder() on the subfolder.\nCheck the elapsed time and save progress if execution time is near the limit.\nImplement retry logic with exponential backoff in case of API errors.\n3. handleBoxFile()\nPurpose:\nDownloads a file from Box using its API and creates the file in the designated Google Drive\nfolder.\nKey Steps:\nConstruct the download URL and execute the API request.\nIf successful, retrieve the file blob, set its name, and create the file in Drive.\nLog the creation of the new file with its Box ID.388\n4. handleBoxFolder()\nPurpose:\nCreates a matching subfolder in Google Drive for a Box folder if it does not already exist.\nKey Steps:\nCreate a new folder in Drive with the Box folder\u02bcs name.\nSet the description to include the Box folder ID.\nLog the creation of the new folder.\n5. checkAndTrashOrphansRecursively()\nPurpose:\nRecursively checks the Drive folder for items that no longer exist in Box (orphans) and\neither logs or trashes them based on the DRY_RUN setting.\nKey Steps:\nRetrieve the listing of files and folders in the Drive folder.\nCompare against the global sets of Box items.\nFor orphaned files and folders, either log that they would be trashed or actually trash\nthem.\n6. getDriveFilesAndFolders()\nPurpose:\nRetrieves (or builds from cache) a listing of files and folders in a given Google Drive folder\nusing descriptions to match Box IDs.\nKey Steps:\nIterate over files and folders in the specified Drive folder.\nParse each item\u02bcs description for a Box ID using \nparseBoxIdFromDescription().\nStore the items in a cache for performance and return the mapping.389\n7. parseBoxIdFromDescription()\nPurpose:\nExtracts the Box file or folder ID from the description text of a Drive item.\nKey Steps:\nLook for the prefix (\"Box File ID:\" or \"Box Folder ID:\") in the description.\nReturn the Box ID if found, otherwise return null.\n8. renameIfChanged()\nPurpose:\nCompares the name of a Drive item with the name from Box and updates the Drive item\u02bcs\nname if they differ.\nKey Steps:\nCheck if the current Drive name differs from the Box name.\nRename the item and log the change if needed.\n9. logEntry()\nPurpose:\nAppends a log entry to the provided logging spreadsheet.\nKey Steps:\nRecord the current date/time, a status string, and a message.390\n10. sendErrorNotification()\nPurpose:\nSends an email notification in the event of a critical error during the sync process.\nKey Steps:\nConstruct an email with a subject and error details.\nSend the email via MailApp.sendEmail.\nTextual Diagram\nBelow is a textual diagram that outlines the main components and their interactions:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0

Point:boxgwsyncvendor() initializes the process.\nRecursive Sync:syncBoxFolder() is the heart of the synchronization, recursively\nhandling both files and folders.\nFile/Folder Handling:\nFiles are processed by downloading (via handleBoxFile()) and optionally\nrenaming.\nFolders are created in Drive using handleBoxFolder() and further processed\nrecursively.\nOrphan Cleanup: After synchronization, orphans in Drive (those without corresponding\nBox IDs) can be trashed via checkAndTrashOrphansRecursively().\nLogging & Notifications: Logging is done to a Google Spreadsheet, and any critical errors\ntrigger email notifications.\nContract Sync Schedule and Considerations : \nSync Frequency: The contract synchronization process is scheduled to run two hour.\nPotential Delay Factors:\nIntermittent empty responses from the Box API endpoint\nOccasional Apps Script execution failures (e.g., \"JavaScript engine reported an\nunexpected error. Error code: INTERNAL\")\nImpact Frequency: Such issues are rare and typically affect no more than 4\u20135 sync\nexecutions per day.393\nBox Customer Folder Sync\nOverview\nConstants & Configuration\nCore Functions\nMain Job: boxgwsyncjob1test4890\nRecursive Sync: syncBoxFolder\nFile Handling: handleBoxFile\nFolder Handling: handleBoxFolder\nOrphan Check: checkAndTrashOrphansRecursively\nDrive Listing: getDriveFilesAndFolders\nUtility Functions\nError Handling & Logging\nTextual Diagram\nUsage Notes\nTrigger Schedule\nOverview\nThe code synchronizes content from a specified Box folder to a corresponding Google Drive\nfolder. It:\nFetches Box items (files and folders) via the Box API.\nDownloads Box files and creates matching files in Google Drive.\nCreates corresponding folders in Drive for Box folders.\nKeeps track of global Box IDs to later identify and trash orphaned files/folders in Drive.\nLogs activities to a Google Sheets log.\nImplements error handling with retry logic and notifies via email in case of exceptions.\nConstants & Configuration\nDRY_RUN:\nA Boolean flag. When set to true, deletion actions (trashing orphan items) are394\nsimulated.\nDefault: false (actual deletions occur).\nMAX_RETRIES:\nMaximum number of retries for API calls before throwing an error.\nDefault: 3.\nOther configuration parameters (e.g., folder IDs, log sheet ID) are defined within the main job\nfunction.\nCore Functions\nMain Job: boxgwsyncjob1test4890\nPurpose:\nInitiates the sync process by retrieving an access token, initializing logging, and managing\nprogress using script properties.\nKey Steps:\na. Retrieve Box access token.\nb. Log start of the sync.\nc. Retrieve stored progress and set the initial folder and offset.\nd. Call syncBoxFolder to process the folder recursively.\ne. On completion, log success and clear progress; otherwise, log that progress is saved for\nresumption.\nf. Handle exceptions with logging and error notification.\nRecursive Sync: syncBoxFolder\nPurpose:\nRecursively syncs a Box folder to a matching Google Drive folder.\nKey Steps:395\ne. Build the Box API URL with the given offset and fetch folder items.\nf. Parse the JSON response and validate data.\ng. Retrieve current Drive listing via getDriveFilesAndFolders.\nh. For each Box item:\ni. Files:\nAdd Box file ID to globalBoxItems.files.\nIf not in Drive, call handleBoxFile to create it; otherwise, check and rename if\nneeded.\nj. Folders:\nAdd Box folder ID to globalBoxItems.folders.\nIf not in Drive, call handleBoxFolder to create it and then recursively process\nit; otherwise, check and rename if necessary and then recursively process it.\nk. Check elapsed time and save progress if nearing the execution time limit.\nl. If there are more items (e.g., 100 items per page), indicate that processing should\ncontinue.\nm. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient errors.\nFile Handling: handleBoxFile\nPurpose:\nDownloads a Box file and creates it in the target Google Drive folder.\nProcess:\na. Construct a download URL using the Box file ID.\nb. Fetch file content from Box.\nc. Convert the response to a blob and upload it to Drive.\nd. Set the file description to include the Box File ID.\ne. Log the file upload action.396\nFolder Handling: handleBoxFolder\nPurpose:\nCreates a new folder in Google Drive that corresponds to a Box folder.\nProcess:\na. Create a folder in Drive with the Box folder name.\nb. Set the folder description with the Box Folder ID.\nc. Log the folder creation.\nOrphan Check: checkAndTrashOrphansRecursively\nPurpose:\nScans the Drive folder tree for items that no longer exist in Box (orphans) and trashes\nthem.\nProcess:\nc. Retrieve files and folders from the Drive folder.\nd. For each item:\ne. If its Box ID is not present in the global items list, either simulate or execute trashing\nbased on the DRY_RUN flag.\nf. Recursively apply the process to subfolders.\nDrive Listing: getDriveFilesAndFolders\nPurpose:\nBuilds or retrieves (from a cache) a mapping of Box IDs to corresponding Drive files and\nfolders within a given Drive folder.\nProcess:\na. Iterate over all files in the folder, parse descriptions to extract Box File IDs, and store\nthem in a map.397\nb. Iterate over subfolders, parse descriptions for Box Folder IDs, and store them in a map.\nc. Cache the results for subsequent calls.\nUtility Functions\nparseBoxIdFromDescription:\nExtracts the Box ID from a description string by identifying the proper prefix (either Box\nFile ID: or Box Folder ID:).\nrenameIfChanged:\nChecks if the Drive item\u02bcs name differs from the Box item name and renames it\naccordingly, logging the change.\nlogEntry:\nWrites a log entry to the configured Google Sheets log. Logs include a timestamp, status,\nand message.\nsendErrorNotification:\nSends an email notification if an exception occurs during processing.\nError Handling & Logging\nThe code uses a try/catch mechanism to handle exceptions during the sync process.\nIt logs errors, warnings, and debug information to the log sheet.\nThe retry mechanism in syncBoxFolder uses exponential backoff and limits retries to\nthe MAX_RETRIES constant.\nOn reaching the maximum retries, the error is logged and re-thrown, triggering an error\nnotification via email.398\nTextual Diagram\nBelow is a textual diagram

Notes\nConfiguration:\nUpdate the placeholder IDs (Box folder ID, Google Drive folder ID, log sheet ID, and sheet\nname) with the actual values before deployment.\nDRY_RUN Mode:\nSet DRY_RUN to true to simulate deletion of orphan files/folders without actually\ntrashing them. Ensure this is set to false for production runs.\nTime-Driven Execution:\nThe sync process saves its progress if nearing the script execution time limit (28 minutes\n20 seconds). This ensures that long-running syncs can resume from the last saved\nprogress.\nLogging & Notifications:\nMonitor the log sheet for real-time updates. Email notifications are sent upon encountering\ncritical errors.\nTrigger Schedule\nContract Sync Schedule and Considerations : \nSync Frequency: The contract synchronization process is scheduled to run every hour.\nPotential Delay Factors:\nIntermittent empty responses from the Box API endpoint\nOccasional Apps Script execution failures (e.g., \"JavaScript engine reported an\nunexpected error. Error code: INTERNAL\")\nImpact Frequency: Such issues are rare and typically affect no more than 4\u20135 sync\nexecutions per day.401\nBox Sync Legal Templates for Allego & Web\nNote : Authentication token is being generated by Auth Script (Authentication And Log Sheet )\n1.

Build Drive map\nRecursively scans the target Drive folder for any existing file/folder descriptions tagged with Box * ID: and maps them by Box ID.\n3. Sync each Box folder\nCalls syncBoxFolderV2(), which:\nFetches items from Box (paginated & retryable)\nDetects duplicates within the current Drive folder\nFor each item:\nFiles: calls handleFileItemV2()\nFolders: calls handleFolderItemV2()\nSaves progress if execution time nears a 28-minute cutoff (Apps Script limit)\nRecurses on next page or returns completion status\n4.

Script Functionality Overview   \n1**Primary Purpose**\n2The script syncs an entire Box folder tree into Google Drive, maintaining folder structure, file versions, and handling complex scenarios like\nfile moves, renames, and deletions.\n3\n4### \ufffd\ufffd **Key Features**\n5\n6#### **1. Resumable Synchronization**\n7- Uses pagination (100 items per request) to handle large folders\n8- Saves progress in Google Apps Script properties to resume from where it left off\n9- Implements timeout handling (28.3 minutes) to work within Google Apps Script limits\n10\n11#### **2. Robust Error Handling**\n12- Retry mechanism with exponential backoff (up to 3 retries)\n13- Graceful error recovery with detailed logging\n14- Skips orphan cleanup if errors occur to prevent data loss\n15\n16#### **3. Intelligent File Management**\n17- **Version Control**: Tracks Box file versions and updates Google Drive files when newer versions exist\n18- **Move Detection**: Automatically moves files when their Box parent folder changes\n19- **Duplicate Detection**: Identifies and logs duplicate Box IDs in Google Drive\n20- **Orphan Cleanup**: Removes files/folders from Google Drive that no longer exist in Box\n21\n22#### **4. Metadata Preservation**\n23- Stores Box IDs in Google Drive file/folder descriptions for tracking\n24- Maintains version numbers in descriptions for version comparison\n25- Preserves folder structure and hierarchy\n26\n27### :arrows_counterclockwise: **Sync Process Flow**\n28\n291. **Initialization**\n30- Loads progress from previous runs\n31- Builds global map of existing Google Drive files by Box ID\n32- Sets up logging to Google Sheets\n33\n342. **Recursive Folder Processing**\n35- Fetches Box folder contents via API with pagination\n36- For each item (file/folder):\n37 - Checks if it exists in Google Drive\n38 - Handles new items, updates, moves, and renames\n39 - Recursively processes subfolders\n40\n413. **File Handling Logic**\n42- **New Files**: Downloads from Box and uploads to Google Drive\n43- **Existing Files**: Checks version numbers and updates if newer\n44- **Moved Files**: Reparents in Google Drive and removes old copies\n45- **Renamed Files**: Updates names in Google Drive\n46\n474. **Cleanup Phase**\n48- Identifies orphaned files/folders (exist in Drive but not in Box)\n49- Removes untagged items (not created by this sync)\n50- Logs all actions for audit trail\n51\n52### \ufffd\ufffd  **Safety Features**405\n53\n54- **Dry Run Mode**: `DRY_RUNV2` flag to preview changes without making them\n55- **Comprehensive Logging**: All actions logged to Google Sheets with timestamps\n56- **Error Notifications**: Email alerts for critical errors\n57- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues processing even if individual items fail\n58\n59\n60The script needs these configuration values:\n61- `BOX_FOLDER_IDV2`: Source Box folder ID\n62- `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_IDV2`: Target Google Drive folder ID\n63- `LOG_SHEET_IDV2`: Google Sheets ID for logging\n64- `LOG_SHEET_NAMEV2`: Sheet name for logs\n65- Box API access token (via `getBoxAccessToken()` function)\n66\n67\n68#### **Smart Caching**\n69- Uses `driveCache` to avoid repeated Google Drive API calls\n70- Maintains `globalDriveFileMapV2` for cross-folder move detection\n71\n72#### **API Efficiency**\n73- Batches operations where possible\n74- Uses Google Drive API's `Drive.Files.update()` for efficient file moves\n75- Implements proper rate limiting with `Utilities.sleep()`\n76\n77#### **Data Integrity**\n78- Validates API responses before processing\n79- Handles empty responses and malformed data\n80- Preserves file metadata and relationships406\nIT SOP407\nPost App Procurement: IT Activities\nPurpose\nScope\nProcess Steps\nRoles and Responsibilities\nContact\nPurpose\nThis document outlines the steps the IT and Procurement team must follow after the\nprocurement of a new application, ensuring its readiness for end-user access and integration\ninto the organization\u02bcs IT systems.\nScope\nApplies to all applications procured by the Procurement Team and handed over to the IT\nteam before being made available to users.\nProcess Steps\n1. New Application/Service On-boarding - Procurement\u00a0\nOnce an application is purchased and approved for organizational use, the procurement\u00a0\nteam must notify the IT team to initiate access configurations as the first step.\u00a0\nThis step ensures that the necessary initial settings are completed before the application is\nmade available to administrators or designated app owners, and subsequently to theDocument Owner:@Gokila A\nVersion: 1.0\nPublished Date:Dec 23, 2024\nReviewed &Approved By:@Antony Godwin408\nbroader user base.\n2. Configure Authentication - IT team\nDetermine the app's supported authentication methods:\nSAML Configuration: Set up and test Single Sign-On (SSO) with Google Workspace.\u00a0\nMFA Configuration: If Google SAML is not supported by the application, verify they have\nalternative controls like multi-factor authentication if supported and configure the same.\nIT to directly work with the respective application support (Vendor) team to have the SAML\nconfigured before onboarding users.\n3. Receive Application Details\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Confirm the application details from the Procurement Team:\nApplication name - To display in Lumos app store and other records\nOwner - Individual/Team who owns the Application.\nAdmin - Who will work on access provisioning.\nAccess request Approval process - as proposed by the app owner.\nLicensing information - Type of subscription/plan (Only for IT)\n4. Add the Application to Lumos - IT\u00a0\nLog into the Lumos platform.\nAdd the new application with the above details to the Lumos app store.\nAdd the application admin and Manager details to the app for the access workflow.\nAdd automatic provisioning to the SSO group for SAML implemented applications.\u00a0\n5. Integration Check\nExplore available integrations with Lumos for managing access provisioning or\ndeprovisioning.\nConfigure integrations as applicable or create request integration with Lumos for the app.\n6. Validation and Testing409\nPerform a functional validation of the application\u02bcs configuration.\nTest user access scenarios to ensure smooth login and functionality.\n7. Handover to Users\nThe IT team should add initial users to the application in Lumos and the SAML group, if\napplicable.\nProvide the application admin or owner with guidance on requesting application access in\nLumos for future user requests and instructions on logging in to the application if SSO is\nimplemented\nInform relevant teams and users about the application's availability.\nRoles and Responsibilities\nIT Team \nEnsure successful configuration and integration of the application.\nValidate application functionality and security compliance.\nProcurement Team\nProvide all necessary documentation and details about the procured application.\nIntimate App owners to only use the application after IT completing the configuration.\nContact\nFor any inquiries, please reach out to us at helpdesk@contentstack.com.410\nLearning Sessions411\nJayKishan412\nCompTIA N+\nNetwork+ (Plus) Certification | CompTIA\nSession Start Date: Jan 27, 2025\n1.

If\nan app provisions\nto a specific\npermission, that\nmeans a\npermission must\nbe selected. If an\napp requires a\ncustom intake\nfield, similarly the\nfield must be\nfilled in.\nIn this case, it\nlooks like the456\nZoom app had a\ncustom intake\nfield added called\n'Zoom License' \nafter the access\npolicy was\ncreated, which\nmust be selected.\nSince the access\npolicy is\nconsidered invalid\nwithout this\ncustom intake\nfield completed, it\nwon't let you save\nit.\nTo fix this issue,\nyou'll need to\nselect the 'Zoom'\napp and edit it to\nselect a license.\nOnce you do that,\nyou'll be able to\n'Save Changes'\non the modal and\nmake any\nadditional edits.\nHowever, I want to\ncall out that I was\nalso unable to\npinpoint this, given\nthe lack of error\ndisplay. So, the\nteam is taking this\ninto consideration\nfor improvements of457\nour access policies\ntab. We can expect\nmore visual\nsignifiers to direct\nusers to where the\nerror lies for\nupdating.

These shortcuts are added and organized by the space administrator. Space admins\ncan link to pages in the space, other related spaces, or relevant external web content as well\nas reorder the shortcuts as needed.\nAdd a header image. This gives your\noverview visual appeal and makes it\nwelcoming for visitors.\nExplain what the space is for. Start by\nsummarizing the purpose of the space. This\ncould be your team's mission statement or a\nbrief description of the kind of work you do.\nShare team goals. Add links to your team's \nOKRs, project plans, and product\nroadmaps so visitors can quickly get a\nsense of your team's goals.\nTell people how to contact you. Share your\ntimezone and links to Slack channels, email\naliases, or other contact details your team\nuses so visitors can contact you with\nquestions or feedback about your team's\nwork.487\nStart discussions with inline comments\nThoughtful responses can get lost and lose context as email replies pile up. And if you\nneglect to copy someone or want to add them later on, it's difficult for them to get up to\nspeed. Inline comments allow anyone (or everyone) to huddle around an idea while\nreferencing key information on the project page.\nTo leave an inline comment, highlight text on the page and the comment icon will appear.\nTeam members with permission to access the page can respond to any comment. Plus, when\na comment thread comes to its natural conclusion, comments can be resolved and cleared\naway.\nLoop in team members with @mentions\n@mentions on Confluence function like\n@mentions on social media platforms like\nTwitter, Instagram, and Slack. Type the @\nsymbol on a Confluence page or in a\ncomment, begin spelling a team member's\nfirst name, and a list will appear. Select the\nindividual to ask a question or assign a task.\n488\nEndorse ideas with reactions\nTake your Confluence space to the next level\nUseful elements for Team spaceUse reactions when you want to support a\ncomment or acknowledge you've seen one\nwithout clogging up the thread with another\ncomment.\nYou can also use reactions on a page or\nblog post. The author of the content will be\nnotified, and if enough team members react\nor add comments to the content, it'll be\nsurfaced on Confluence home feed\nExtend the capabilities of your Confluence\npages by  adding extra functionality or\nincluding dynamic content.\nTo add functionality:\n1. Type ' / ' to open the list of items available\nto use\n2. Find the item to be inserted and select it\n3. Select Insert\nIntroduce the team\nAdd user profiles to display a short\nsummary of a given Confluence user's\nprofile with their role, profile photo and\ncontact details.489\nShare news and announcements with\nyour team\nDisplay a stream of latest blog posts so\nyour team can easily see what's been going\non.\nDisplay a list of important pages\nPaste in page URLs to create smart links, or\nuse the content report table to create a\nlist of all the pages in the space."}, {"source": "PDF: How to Self-Setup Slack Connect for Endusers to work with External Org.pdf", "text": "\u2022 Slack Connect for ChannelsWhen you need to work as a group, you can use a Slack channel to host up to 250 organizations.
